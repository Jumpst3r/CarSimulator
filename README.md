# CarSimulator
Tuning PID parameters using a particle swarm algorithm

Developed as part of the IN.4028 Process Control [FS 18] course, this project aims to illustrate automatic PID parameter tuning using a particle swarm algorithm.

The PID controller is used to control the speed of a car (cruise control system), given a car simulation library.
